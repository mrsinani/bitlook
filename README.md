# 🌐 About Bitlook

## 💡 Inspiration

**Bitlook** was born out of a shared frustration: Bitcoin data is scattered, overwhelming, and often too technical for everyday users. From tracking blockchain stats to accessing Lightning Network insights, we found ourselves jumping across multiple platforms, piecing together what should have been readily available in one place.

We wanted to build a tool that **centralizes Bitcoin intelligence**—from real-time blockchain and Lightning Network analytics to curated news and education—so users can make informed decisions faster. As Bitcoin adoption grows, especially with the expansion of the Lightning Network, there's a clear need for a **focused, Bitcoin-first dashboard** that's intuitive, powerful, and user-friendly.

## 🚀 What it does

Bitlook centralizes Bitcoin insights by offering:

- Real-time blockchain and Lightning Network analytics
- Lightning wallet integration for instant transactions
- Curated news and updates relevant to Bitcoin
- AI-powered chatbot for on-demand Bitcoin education

## 🛠️ How we built it

We used a modern full-stack approach:

- **Vite** with **React** for a dynamic frontend
- **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling and type safety
- **Direct API calls** for real-time blockchain data updates
- Lightning Network APIs for statistics integration
- Standard API calls for news aggregation
- Chatbot UI component

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

- Managing real-time data without performance issues
- Poor or incomplete documentation on Lightning APIs
- UI/UX balance: presenting dense data simply
- Training and fine-tuning the chatbot to reduce hallucinations _(challenge for future implementation)_

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Built a functional dashboard with Bitcoin and Lightning Network statistics
- Created a polished and intuitive UI that simplifies Bitcoin analytics
