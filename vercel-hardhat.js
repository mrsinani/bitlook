// This file is used to configure Hardhat for Vercel deployment
// For production, we'll use a remote blockchain service like Infura or Alchemy

// Set environment variables
process.env.HARDHAT_NETWORK = "ropsten"; // or another testnet/mainnet

// Deploy contracts to testnet/mainnet
// Code to deploy contracts to a public network would go here

console.log("Hardhat setup for Vercel complete");

// For actual production deployment, you would:
// 1. Deploy your contracts to a testnet or mainnet
// 2. Store the deployed contract addresses in environment variables
// 3. Configure your frontend to use those addresses instead of local deployments
